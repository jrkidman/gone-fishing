// code to generate random fish (WHICH WILL GO IN AN OBJECT!!!)
//      == will need a randomly generated name WITH two adjectives and a type of fish. 
//      == will also need a random weight and a random dollar value

//generating a RANDOM FISH NAME-
    //  create 3 arrays with 10 values in each:
    //  1- ten fish adjectives
    //  2- ten fish adjectives
    //  3- ten fish types
    



//to generate the random name, take a RANDOM adjective from the first array, a RANDOM adjective from the second array, and a RANDOM fish type from the third array, and put them together
    //to get a random value from an array, generate a random value from 0 and the last index in the array (array.length-1)


// generate the random fish weight and value
    // random weight between 0 and 10 with two decimal points
    // random value between 0 and 1,000 then divide by 100, output in dollars/cents
